DATA
California Housing Price
Context
The data contains information from the 1990 California census. So, although it may not help you with predicting current housing prices, it does provide an accessible introduction dataset for teaching people about the basics of machine learning.
Features
The data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats based on the 1990 census data. Be warned that the data arenâ€™t cleaned, so some preprocessing steps are required! The columns are as follows, and their names are pretty self-explanatory:
longitude
latitude
Housing median age
total_rooms
total_bedrooms
population
households
median_income
median house value
ocean_proximity
